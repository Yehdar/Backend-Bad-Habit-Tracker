# Backend-Bad-Habit-Tracker
- Created a backend bad habit tracker with python back in July/August 2022 that automated and documented the time and money saved.
- Imported Pandas library to act as the pd
- Used tabulate to make the data look better



WAS MASSIVELY INSPIRED FROM THIS VIDEO: https://youtu.be/snUk2Dx9Bz8
- Used the video above as the backbone to the project (that said, of course, I added my own twist)
