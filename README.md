# Backend-Bad-Habit-Tracker
- Created a backend bad habit tracker with python that automates and documents the time and money saved.
- Imported Pandas library to act as the pd
- Used tabulate to make data look more pleasing

- Used the video above as the backbone to the project (that said, of course, I added my own twist)
