# DO YOU NEED AN AUTOMATED HABIT TRACKER TO ENCOURAGE YOU TO QUIT YOUR BAD HABITS?? WELL LOOK NO FURTHER!! 

## DETAILS
- Created a backend bad habit tracker with python back in July/August 2022 that automated and documented the time and money saved.
- Imported Datatime database from Pandas for the data
- Used tabulate to make everything outputted look better

## DRAWBACKS
- No front-end (as such, the UI is awful. That said, this is a back-end project)

## TAKEAWAYS
- Make a second part to this project by integrating a front-end to make the habit tracker more visually-pleasing

## SHOUT-OUTS
MASSIVELY INSPIRED FROM THIS VIDEO: https://youtu.be/snUk2Dx9Bz8
- Used the video above as the backbone to the project
